Lecture6
	Sorting arrays and lists
	Comparable interface
		has a single method called 'compareTo(Object o)'
			returns:
				if less than:	-1
				greater than:	1
				equal to:		0
		this method is what allows java to sort arrays of strings

	Slide 35
		an 'in-line' class instantiation
		an anonymous interclass, because the class name is never defined

Lecture7
	Inheritance
		you IMPLEMENTS an interface
			a class can implement multiple interfaces
		you EXTEND an inheritance (abstract superclass)
			a class can extend only ONE class
				you get the methods from the Object class, and Class class automatically
			Inheritance isA
			Composition hasA

	Object class methods
		must know equals(), hashCode(), and toString()

	Override, must exactly match the name of the method you want to override
		toString()

		@Override - instead of getting the name of class@hexcode, print "whatever 'area'"
		public String toString()
		{
			return "whatever" + getArea();
		}

		super.toString()
